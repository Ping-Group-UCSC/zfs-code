This code calculates the ZFS parameter as in the article
    ”First principles method for the calculation of zero-field splitting tensors in periodic systems”,
    M. J. Rayson and P. R. Briddon, Physical Review B 77, 035119 (2008)

Quick Installation:
    make
("make" will compile all code and link executables in 'bin/')

Further Information:
The calculation requires scf output with pw_export followed by conversion bash script to generate
simple grid and wfc input files.

The flow of the calculation is as follows:
    1. input bands to compute and location of grid of wfc files
    2. read npw, grid, and wfc
    3. calculate f1(G), f2(-G), f3(G)
    4. calculate ρ(G-G')
    5. calculate D_(ab); including ZFS parameter
